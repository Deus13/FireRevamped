# Fire Revampt


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** v1.56 by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


This mod massivly changes the fire mechanics of the game.
All fuels have Centigrademinutes, which are calculated form the base fuel values, which are also adjustable in the settings.
When fuel is added to a fire, the duration and heat of the fire will change, depending on how hot and big the fire is.
Hotter fires will consume more Centigrademinutes per miunte than a colder fires.
The mod adds fireshaping options: spread fires: trade fireheat against burntime and heap fires: trades burntime against fireheat.
Fires can also be extinguished wich returns some of the items with reduced conditions.
Fires will heat the surrounding area and allows for heating houses and caves for long times, even when the fire is not burning anymore.
